# Project Title: 
IS 2021 THE YEAR TO ENTER INTO THE PROPERTY PROPERTY MARKET IN CANBERRA?

<!-- description -->
# Project Description:

For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualisations. Here are the specific requirements:

Your visualisation must include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
 -   A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
 -   A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
 -   A  server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualisation (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
Your final visualisation should ideally include at least three views. For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.


Working with Your Group

When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:
    Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.
    
    Set up an agile project by using GitHub Projects Links to an external site.so that your group can track tasks.
    
    Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:
          -  Project ideation
          -  Data fetching/API integration
          -  Data analysis
          -  Testing
          -  Creating documentation
          -  Creating the presentation
Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project by the end of the first week in order to stay on track.
Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.
